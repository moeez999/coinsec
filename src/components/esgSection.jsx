          The COINSEC Network is designed to drive investment in renewable
          energy. As more transactions are processed through the network, the
          demand for energy increases, directly boosting the generation of
          renewable energy. This model creates a virtuous cycle where increased
          network activity leads to greater renewable energy production and
          investment. The COINSEC Network acts as the engine, propelling the
          growth of sustainable energy solutions while ensuring a secure and
          efficient blockchain infrastructure.
