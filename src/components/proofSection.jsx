          The COINSEC Network features a deflationary mechanism through its
          Chromatic Halving Schedule. This emission schedule ensures that mining
          rewards decrease smoothly every month, culminating in a 50% reduction
          in annual emissions. This gradual reduction helps control inflation
          and enhances the scarcity of SEC tokens, resulting in a potential
          increase in the value of tokens over time.
